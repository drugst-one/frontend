<p-card class="dt-card" [style]="{padding:'15px', margin:'5px'}" header="How to integrate drugst.one?">
    We prepared this plugin in a way that the integration process is as easy as currently possible. To add the necessary
    script and style files to your project, just add the code below to the <code>{{"<"}}head{{">"}}</code> section of
    your <i><b>index.html</b></i> file.
    <app-code lang="html" [code]="general.plugin"></app-code>
    Based on the framework you use in your project, additional configuration may be necessary. Check out the section
    below for more information on that.
    Adjusting the version tag helps you to use some specific version of the drugst.one plugin (<a
        href="https://github.com/AndiMajore/drugstone-releases/tags" target="_blank">Version List</a>), but older
    versions may not be supported forever. A tag for the automatic use of the newest version is not yet integrated but
    is worked on.
    <br>
    After adding a valid version of drugst.one to your project a <i>html component</i> is exposed that can be then used
    to add a default drugst.one panel to your website.
    <app-code lang="html" [code]="general.body"></app-code>
    The customization of the panel is achieved by handing over parameters to the component. All the configuration
    parameters, their syntax and structure can be checked in the <a (click)="tabChange(4)">Documentation</a> or
    interactively explored and set
    in the <a (click)="tabChange(3)">Playground</a> tab. Any configuration created there can be copied and directly
    added to your project and provides an easy way to quickly set up drugst.one to your liking and to get familiar with
    its use. <br>
    The color theme of drugst.one can also be adjusted freely by setting specific css variables for your website. These
    can be of course adjusted manually, but again the <i>Playground</i> tab has some nice features to create a theme
    that fits into your application. The available variables are the following:
    <app-code lang="css" [code]="getTheme()"></app-code>
</p-card>
<app-panel headerIcon="fab fa-angular" title="AngularJS">
    <div class="p-content">
        For AngularJS the first step in integrating drugst.one is the same as for basic html. By loading script and
        style in the head of the index.html of the project, a custom component is made available.
        <app-code lang="html" [code]="angular.plugin"></app-code>
        To allow AngularJS to use this component the following <code>schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]</code> entry needs to be added in the <i>module.ts</i>
        file:
        <app-code lang="typescript" [code]="angular.app"></app-code>
        After that the tag can be used in any template file of the project:
        <app-code lang="html" [code]="angular.body"></app-code>
    </div>
</app-panel>
<app-panel headerIcon="fab fa-vuejs" title="Vue.js">
    <div class="p-content">
        For Vue.js the first step in integrating drugst.one is the same as for basic html. By loading script and
        style in the head of the index.html of the project, a custom component is made available.
        <app-code lang="html" [code]="vue.plugin"></app-code>
        To be able to use the component provided by the drugst.one plugin, the component has to be registered in the <i>vue.config.js</i> by adding the following <code>externals</code> entry:
        <app-code lang="javascript" [code]="vue.app"></app-code>
        After that the tag can be used in any template file of the project:
        <app-code lang="html" [code]="vue.body"></app-code>
    </div>
</app-panel>
