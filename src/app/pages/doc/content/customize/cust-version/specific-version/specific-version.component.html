  Apart from this another option for the latest development and thus newest
  release candidate version would be:
  <app-code lang="html" [code]="versionCode"></app-code>
  Here <code>{{ version }}</code> refers to the specific version. To load the latest
  committed version of drugst.one, the 'nightly' tag can be used:
  <p-messages severity="warn">
    <ng-template pTemplate>
      <div>
        Be aware that nightly versions are not guaranteed to be stable because they are
        in the middle of developing the next version!
      </div>
    </ng-template>
  </p-messages>
  <app-code lang="html" [code]="nightlyCode"></app-code>
