You have the possibility to select any tagged version of Drugst.One in your project.
<p-messages severity="warn">
    <ng-template pTemplate>
        <div>Be aware that older versions might not be supported at some point regarding the according backend endpoints!</div>
    </ng-template>
</p-messages>

Like introduced in the <a (click)="navigateTo('basics')">basic setup</a> section best practice is to always include the newest minor version release:
<app-code lang="html" [code]="basicCode"></app-code>
Apart from this another option for the latest development and thus newest release candidate version would be:
<app-code lang="html" [code]="versionCode"></app-code>
Here <code>{{version}}</code> refers to the specific version tag and <code>{{server}}</code> to a specific backend server.
To load the latest committed version of drugst.one, the "nightly" tag can be used
<p-messages severity="warn">
    <ng-template pTemplate>
        <div>Be aware that nightly are not guaranteed to be stable because they are in the middle of developing the next version!</div>
    </ng-template>
</p-messages>
<app-code lang="html" [code]="nightlyCode"></app-code>

The available versions can be checked here:
