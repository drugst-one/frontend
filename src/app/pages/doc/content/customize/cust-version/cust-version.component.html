Like introduced in the <a (click)="navigateTo('basics')">basic setup</a> section best practice is to always include the newest minor version release:
<app-code lang="html" [code]="basicCode"></app-code>
Apart from this another option for the latest development and thus newest release candidate version would be:
<app-code lang="html" [code]="versionCode"></app-code>
Here <code>{{version}}</code> refers to the specific version tag and <code>{{server}}</code> to a specific backend server.
The available versions can be checked here:
TODO create index.html for http://ml-s-zbhdock2.ad.uni-hamburg.de/cdn/ with table of versions.
