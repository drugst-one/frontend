<p>
  The network is based on
  <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/" target="_blank"
    >Vis.js version 9.1.6</a
  >. Therefore, Drugst.One supports all options available for Vis.js networks as
  describes on the
  <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/" target="_blank"
    >official Vis.js webpage</a
  >. The nodes and edges can be defined in the parameter 'network' while the
  styles for nodes and edges should be defined in the parameter 'groups' under
  the keys 'nodeGroups' and 'edgeGroups', respectively. Each group (nodeGroups
  and edgeGroups) is defined by a key and an object. A minimal example of how
  the groups could look like is shown in
  <a href="/doc#customize_general">'groups'</a>.
</p>

<p>
  While the node and edge styles are defined in the 'group' parameter, the
  network parameter in the Drugst.One component serves as data input for the
  network. The network has the two attributes 'nodes' and 'edges', which each
  expect a list with objects for nodes and edges, respectively.

</app-code>

<p>
  Here some of the required and some of the optional parameters for the node
  and edge objects are described. Since Drugst.One is using Vis.js, valid node and edge
  parameters in Vis.js can also be used in Drugst.One in addition to the
  parameters describes here.

<p>
  The 'nodes' attributes expects a list with objects for each node. Each node
  must have an unique 'id', which is the only required parameter. The 'id' is
  the node identifier and will be displayed as node name in the network.
  <br />
  For genes/proteins, the 'id' attribute is the gene identifier in the selected
  'identifier' space. For example, if the 'identifier' is 'symbol', valid ids
  are 'PTEN', 'MYC', 'TP53' and so forth. Drugst.One will attempt to map each
  node to a gene/protein entity in its database and fetch corresponding known
  information from the database. If it cannot be mapped, it will still display
  the node with all attributes that are passed in the node object. However, this
  node will not be available for selection and thus for the analysis tasks.
</p>

<p-messages severity="info">
  <ng-template pTemplate>
    <div>
      All node objects must have an unique 'id' attribute, regardless whether
      they are biological entities.
    </div>
  </ng-template>
</p-messages>

<p>
  Other nodes which do not represent genes/proteins will still have to have an
  'id' attribute. In this case, the 'id' will still be used to display the name
  of the node in the network.

network = {

}
'

</app-code>

<p>
  In addition to the 'id', each should have a
  <a href="/doc#customize_group_configuration">'group'</a> that it is assigned.
  The node will inherit all styles defined in the group. Note that the group
  assigned to a node must exist in the nodeGroups, otherwise an error will be
  thrown.

<p>
  Optionally, properties can be defined for each node which can be used for pruning when showPruning is set 
  to true.

<p>
  The 'edges' attribute expects a list of edge objects, each containing the keys
  'from' and 'to'. The values for these keys must the node 'id' values of the
  source and the target node. By default, the network is undirected. In this
  case, the values of 'from' and 'to' are exchangeable.

<p>
  In addition to the required parameters, each node can also have a 'group'. The
  value of the 'group' must be a key of an
  <a href="/doc#config-edge-groups">'edgeGroup'</a>. If the 'edgeGroup' does not
  exist, an error will be thrown. The edge will inherit all styles defined in
  the edge group.
