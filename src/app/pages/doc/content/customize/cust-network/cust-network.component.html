<p>
  The network is based on
  <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/" target="_blank"
    >Vis.js version 9.0.4 ()</a
  >. Therefore, Drugst.One supports all options available for Vis.js networks as
  describes on the
  <a href="https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/" target="_blank"
    >official Vis.js webpage</a
  >. The nodes and edges can be defined in the parameter "network" while the
  styles for nodes and edges should be defined in the parameter "groups" under
  the keys "nodeGroups" and "edgeGroups", respectively. Each group (nodeGroups
  and edgeGroups) is defined by a key and an object. A minimal example of how
  the groups could look like is shown in "Groups" the under <a
  href="/doc#customize_general_configuration">"General Configuration"</a>.
