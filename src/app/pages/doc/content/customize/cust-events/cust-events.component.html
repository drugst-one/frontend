<p>
    For now we depicted cases of information flow from the host page to the drugstone component
    (<code>{{"<"}}drugst-one{{">"}}</code>).<br>
    To communicate some information from Drugst.One to your host page, if requested, we emit
    events that can be listened to. This is generally achieved by adding an
    <i>EventListener</i> to the component:
    <app-code lang="js"
              code='document.getElementById("drugstone-component-id").addEventListener("$eventName",(event)=>{console.log(event.detail)})'>
    </app-code>
    We select the component by its id (here 'drugstone-component-id') and add the necessary
    <i>EventListener</i> where "$eventName" has to be replaced with one of the events
    specified below. In this example we just want the received content to be printed into
    the browsers console, but this call may be replaced by any custom code, handling the
    event data.<br>
    In the following the specific events will be covered, including the necessary eventName
    to listen to, as well as how the result object is structured. Also some use-cases for
    the received object might be proposed here.
</p>
<p-divider [style]="{marginLeft:'35%', marginRight:'35%', width:'30%'}"
           [align]="'center'"></p-divider>
<div style="padding-left: 15px">
    <div style="font-size: 15pt"><b>Task creation ("taskEvent")</b></div>
    <p>
        Task IDs are emitted when algorithms are applied to subnetworks. This happens both
        for module and drug analysis. These tasks are tracked internally but for general
        result tracking reasons from a hosts perspective it can be necessary to acquire
        them.
        <app-code lang="js"
                  code='document.getElementById("drugstone-component-id").addEventListener("taskEvent,(event)=>{callback(event)})'>
        </app-code>
        The <i>event.detail</i> object, your callback function receives is structured like
        follows:
        <app-code [copy]="false" lang="json" code='{
    "taskId": "GFpwPHkc6gsXGvIx1g83w0hO8i95przG",   // Unique taskID (token) assigned for this task, can be used to request the loading of this specific result
    "algorithm": "multisteiner",                    // The algorithm that was applied on the selected seed nodes
    "target": "drug-target",                        // The type of analysis this search had as goal
    "params": {                                     // Input parameters of the algorithms
        "seeds": ["BRCA2","PTEN"],                 // The selected seed genes the algorithms starts with
        "config": {...},                            // The general drugstone config that was loaded at the moment of execution
        "input_network": {...},                     // The general drugstone network tat was loaded at the moment of execution to be later merged with the results
        "ppi_dataset": "STRING",                    // The database for protein-protein interaction information
        "pdi_dataset": "NeDRex",                  // The database for protein-drug targeting information
        "target": "drug-target",                    // The type of analysis this search has as goal
        "num_trees": 5,                             // Specific multisteiner algorithms parameters
        "tolerance": 10,                            // Specific multisteiner algorithms parameters
        "hub_penalty": 0                            // Specific multisteiner algorithms parameters
    }
}'></app-code>
        The <b><i>taskId</i></b> can be used to tell drugstone programmatically to load a
        specific result. For this similar to the <i>id</i>, <i>config</i> or <i>network</i>
        attributes an additional one (<i>task-id</i>) can be set. It accepts the id of a
        successfully finished task. Example where the taskId from the received object is
        set is shown below:
        <app-code lang="js"
                  code='document.getElementById("drugstone-component-id").setAttribute("task-id", "GFpwPHkc6gsXGvIx1g83w0hO8i95przG")'></app-code>
        or
        <app-code lang="html" code="
<drugst-one
        id='drugstone-component-id'
        config='{...}'
        network='{...}'
        task-id='GFpwPHkc6gsXGvIx1g83w0hO8i95przG'
        >
</drugst-one>"></app-code>
