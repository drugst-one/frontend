<p>
  The Drugst.One component accepts 3 different arguments: 'config', 'groups' and
  'network'.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    'config' describes the general configuration of the app. Here you can
    define, which elements and functionalities you want to include in your
    Drugst.One instance and the position in the app.
  </li>
  <li>
    'groups' defines the labels and styles such as color and shape for each
    node/edge group. These configurations will be applied to each node/edge with
    the according 'group' attribute.
  </li>
  <li>
    'network' contains the complete network data for nodes and edges. Keep in
    mind that you don't need to define edges, instead Drugst.One can load them
    from a PPI dataset of your choice.
  </li>
</ul>
