There are situations where a own setup or integration of Drugst.One is not the best way or even impossible. For this we provide a
<a href="/standalone">Standalone</a> version on this webpage.<br>
There are different ways in which this version can be configured:<br>
<a (click)="navigateTo('standalone-options')">Option 1</a>: It allows you to manually define input nodes, edges and some basic parameters. <br> <a (click)="navigateTo('standalone-url')">Option 2</a>: Further this small network configuration can be passed by URL, which allows simple redirection from any other page to a specific network loaded in our Drugst.One instance. Having some limitations due to the nature of GET requests, we have an additional way to transmit a full Drugst.One configuration first by POST request to our backend server and to then load the exact network using the unique ID with which the server responded.
