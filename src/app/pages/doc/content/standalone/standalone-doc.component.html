<p>There are situations where a own setup or integration of Drugst.One is not the
best way or even impossible. To this end, we provide a
<a href="/standalone">Standalone</a> version on Drugst.One.</p>
<p>
There are different ways in which this version can be accessed:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="doc#standalone_options">GET request</a>: It allows you to
        manually define input nodes, edges and some basic parameters.</li>
    <li><a href="doc#standalone_api">POST request</a>: Further this small
        network configuration can be passed by URL, which allows simple redirection from
        any other page to a specific network loaded in our Drugst.One instance. Having
        some limitations due to the nature of GET requests, we have an additional way to
        transmit a full Drugst.One configuration first by POST request to our backend
        server and to then load the exact network using the unique ID with which the
        server responded.</li>
</ol>
