  The Standalone tab provides a basic and unspecified version of the Drugst.One
  plugin. For once it is a demonstration how Drugst.One can be integrated and
  basic functions and networks can be tested here before or instead of
  integrating it into an own website.
  <app-doc-subsubheader text="Set Nodes"></app-doc-subsubheader>
  To add nodes, simply add a list of nodeIds in the left box. These can be
  separated by tabulator, newline, comma, semicolon or space. Also they have to
  fit the selected ID source. Accepted types are Symbols, Ensembl IDs or UniProt
  Accession numbers. For now the IDs are also case sensitive, so non numeric
  characters are most times written as uppercase letters. All nodes are added to
  the default <i>Gene</i> node group.
  <app-doc-subsubheader text="Set Edges"></app-doc-subsubheader>
  Edges can be defined by entering a newline separated list of node id pairs in
  the right text input field. The node ids can be again separated by tabulator,
  comma, semicolon or space. All entries are added to the group of
  <i>default</i> edges.
  <app-doc-subsubheader text="Network Configuration"></app-doc-subsubheader>
  Some additional options for basic network configuration are available in the
  <b>Advanced</b> panel. For once the source of internally used datasets for
  protein protein interaction (PPI) and drug protein interaction (DPI)
  information can be selected.<br />
  For PPIs we have <a href="https://string-db.org/" target="_blank">STRING</a>,
  <a href="https://thebiogrid.org/" target="_blank">BioGrid</a>,
  <a href="http://apid.dep.usal.es/" target="_blank">APID</a> and 
  <a href="https://omnipathdb.org" target="_blank">OmniPath</a> (directed interactions) to select from.
  <i><b>STRING</b></i> is the <i><b>default dataset</b></i
  >.
  <br />
  For DPIs there are
  <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/" target="_blank">DrugBank</a>,
  <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/" target="_blank">ChEML</a> and
  <a href="https://www.dgidb.org/" target="_blank">DGIdb</a>. Here also the
  first option, <i><b>DrugBank</b></i> is the <i><b>default</b></i> selection.
  <br />
  Further there is an option to allow Drugst.One to add all missing interaction
  edges, based of course on the selected PPI datasource. By
  <i><b>default</b></i> this option is <i><b>enabled</b></i
  >.
