    The main part of Drugst.One is an interactive network along with its legend.
    The network is implement with the
    <a href="/doc#implementation_visjs">visvis.js network library</a>. Nodes and
    edges will be visualized according to the styles defined in their groups. By
    clicking on a node, the node attributes will be displayed in the detail view
    (if enabled) in the sidebar. If Drugst.One can find the gene in its database,
    it is possible to select it and thus use it for the algorithms. Nodes can be
    selected or deselected for analysis with a double click. Selected nodes will
    be the seed nodes for the drug and drug target search algorithms. To visualize
    the selected nodes, the group 'selectedNode' will the merged with the
    according node group style.

    The legend will automatically be generated with the custom node styles defined
    in the groups. Alternatively, it is also possible to pass an image via the
    'legendUrl' parameter. The position of the legend can be set via the option
    'legendPos', which accepts the values 'left' or 'right'. The legend can be
    hidden by setting the parameter 'showLegend' to 'false'. Likewise, the parts
    of the legend describing the nodes or the edges can be hidden by setting
    'showLegendNodes' or 'showLegendEdges' to 'false'. For more information, please refer to the <a
        href="/doc#customize_config">config</a>.
