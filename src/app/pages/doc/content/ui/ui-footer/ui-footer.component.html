    The network menu consists of all options that are directly related to the
    network. It allows you to modify the network, add and remove node types and
    highlight genes based on expression. The complete network information can be
    exported from here e.g. as an image or a json.

        Screenshot: Exports the network as an image. If the legend is generated by
        Drugst.One, it will be included in the image. If the legend is loaded via an
        url, it is currently not possible to include it into the screenshot. Also
        please note that the screenshot function will work if the network nodes have
        images due to security reasons.

        Download: Download the network data as .graphml, .json or .csv format.

    In the analysis mode, the network menu has additionally the functions to
    highlight seed genes used for the analysis.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Seeds: Highlight the seeds used for the analysis in the network. This will
        apply the 'seedNode' group style to the seed nodes.
    </li>
    <!--  <li>-->
    <!--    Connectors: Highlight the connectors in the network. Connectors are genes-->
    <!--    that are included by the analysis because the are connecting the seed node-->
    <!--    to a drug or a gene found by the algorithm. This will apply the-->
    <!--    "connectorNode" style to th connectors.-->
    <!--  </li>-->
