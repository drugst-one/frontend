    The network menu consists of all options that are directly related to the
    network. It allows you to modify the network, add and remove node types and
    highlight genes based on expression. The complete network information can be
    exported from here e.g. as an image or a json.

<ul>
    <li>Reset View: Reset the network zoom and center the network.</li>
    <li>
        Screenshot: Exports the network as an image. If the legend is generated by
        Drugst.One, it will be included in the image. If the legend is loaded via an
        url, it is currently not possible to include it into the screenshot. Also
        please note that the screenshot function will work if the network nodes have
        images due to security reasons.
    </li>
    <li>
        Download: Download the network data as .graphml, .json or .csv format.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tissue: Visualize the expression information for genes in the network based
        on <a href="https://gtexportal.org/home/" target="_blank">GTEx</a> media Tissue
        expression (TPM) values. For the pie chart representation, values are scaled based on the highest expression
        observed in the selected tissue.
    </li>
    <li>
        Label ID space chooser: Choose the ID space for the labels of the proteins. The usual ID spaces
        are available: UniProt, Ensembl, Entrez Gene, Symbol.
    </li>
    <li>Drugs: Display first neighbor drugs for the genes in the network.</li>
    <li>
        Disorders (Protein): Display first neighbor disorders for the genes in the
        network.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disorders (Drug): Display first neighbor drugs for the disorders in the
        network.
    </li>
    <li>Animation: Toggle the network physic (on/off).</li>
    <li>
        Upload: Upload network as .csv, .sif, .gt (id as node property 'name') or .graphml. The properties of 
        .gt and .graphml files are extracted and can be used for pruning. The .sif file can also be a gene/protein list 
        with one gene/protein per line. In the upload window, the ID space of the network needs to be specified. This button
        is hidden when viewing task results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Layout: The nodes are arranged in a hierarchical layout based on the
        layer property which maps the cellular components (cc) of the genes to the higher level compartments: Cytoplasm, 
        Nucleus, Extracellular, Cell surface, Plasma membrane. The layout is based on the Cerebral layout.
        Additional layers are undefined for drugs and disorders, Unknown for genes without (cc) information, Multiple for 
        genes/proteins present in more than one of the higher level cc and Other for when the specific cc couldn't be mapped to
        one of the top level compartments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Overlay Directions: The currently displayed interactions can be overlayed with the directions of the interactions sourced
        from OmniPath. OmniPath is available as a licensed and unlicensed version. The licensed version provides more interactions.
        This button is hidden if OmniPath is chosen as overall background graph as source for protein-protein interactions.
    </li>

<p>
    In the analysis mode, the network menu has additionally the functions to
    highlight seed genes used for the analysis.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Seeds: Highlight the seeds used for the analysis in the network. This will
        apply the 'seedNode' group style to the seed nodes.
    </li>
    <!--  <li>-->
    <!--    Connectors: Highlight the connectors in the network. Connectors are genes-->
    <!--    that are included by the analysis because the are connecting the seed node-->
    <!--    to a drug or a gene found by the algorithm. This will apply the-->
    <!--    "connectorNode" style to th connectors.-->
    <!--  </li>-->
</ul>
