  When the user selected genes in the network, Drugst.One can be used to execute
  network algorithms based on these seed genes. The algorithms can be started in
  the sidebar in the 'Analysis' panel. In the 'Analysis' panel, the user has the
  option to choose between drug and drug target searching algorithms. The user
  can choose between all enabled
  <a href='/doc#implementation_algorithms'>algorithms</a> and configure a number
  of different <a href='/doc#general_algorithm_parameters'>parameters</a> to
  customize the algorithm to their needs. Alternatively, the 'Quick Drug Search'
  and the 'Connect Genes' panels in the sidebar can be used to run predefined
  algorithms. For more information see the
  <a href='/doc#panel_connect_genes'>panel explanations</a>.

  Users can find all their started tasks in the task list element in the
  Drugst.One sidebar. Upon clicking a task in the list, the
  <a href='/doc#drugstone_ui_analysis_window'>analysis window</a> will open
  where the user can browse the task results. For more information about the
  task list, see our
  <a href='/doc#panel_tasks'>description of the 'Tasks' panel</a>.
