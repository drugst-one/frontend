<p>
  The Drugst.One sidebar consists of different panels which can be individually
  integrated or excluded to fit your websites needs. If desired, the complete
  sidebar can be deactivated by setting the parameter "showSidebar" to "false"
  in the config. In the following, each panel and its functionality is
  described.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Detail View"
  id="panel_id_view"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  The detail view shows the node information of the currently selecte node. The
  name and the group of the gene will be displayed here. If a gene can be found
  by Drugst.One in its database, the information will be complemented by
  information from different databases. If a tissue is selected, the exact
  measured expression value will be displayed here when the gene is selected. If
  the gene cab be found in the Drugst.One database and thus is available for
  selection, a button to toggle the selection status fo the gene will be
  displayed.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Network Overview"
  id="panel_network_overview"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  The overview panel shows a summary of the currently displayed network
  consisting of the numbers of edges and nodes.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Query Node"
  id="panel_query_node"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  This panel allows searching nodes in the network. A search bar allows
  filtering the nodes in the network and assists the user with an autocomplete
  function. The query functionality is especially valuable for large and complex
  networks.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Connect Genes"
  id="panel_connect_genes"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  The "Connect Genes" panel offers the option to connect the genes in the
  network with one click. The buttons start a
  <a href="/doc#multi_steiner_trees">Multi-Steiner</a> algorithm on all genes in
  the network or the selected genes. The resulting network find connections
  between the seed genes if any exist.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Simple Analysis"
  id="panel_simple_analysis"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  The "Simple Analysis" panel allows to search for drug candidates with one
  click. It starts a
  <a href="/doc#multi_steiner_trees">Multi-Steiner</a> algorithm on all genes in
  the network or the selected genes, similar to the "Connect Genes" function. In
  a second step, Drugst.One will execute a
  <a href="/doc#closeness_centrality">Closeness Centrality</a> algorithm on the
  resulting network, finding drug candidates that are realted to the original
  seed genes.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Analysis"
  id="panel_analysis"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  The analysis panel gives the user three ways to analyze the selected seed
  genes. The <b>"drug target search"</b> allows to select algorithms that will
  find genes related to the seed genes. It depends on the selected algorithm, if
  the algorithm will try to find genes in between the seed genes or if the
  algorithm searches for new genes in close proximity to the seed genes. These
  genes can extend existing disease module or, if seen in the context of drug
  repurposing, represent putative drug targets. The <b>"drug search"</b> works
  similar, but the algorithms will return a list of putative drugs in the
  network neighborhood of the seed genes. Lastly, the
  <b>"enrichment analysis"</b> will export the list of selected genes to
  <a href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost" target="_blank">g:Profiler</a>
  which offers different profiling and conversion mehtods.
</p>
<p>
  For more information about the algorithm see the
  <a href="/doc#implementation_algorithms">section about algorithms</a>.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader text="Tasks" id="panel_tasks"></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  The task list offers an overview over the tasks and indicates the used
  algorithm, the status of the Task ("running", "done", "failed") and a
  timestamp. While the tasks should never fail, in the case of an error and the
  task status "failed", a short error message will be displayed to inform the
  user. In this case, please <a href="/doc#contact_us">reach out to us</a> with
  the displayed message. In the task list, tasks will be listed chronologically
  from newest to oldest. A click on a task in this list opens the
  <a href="/doc#drugstone_ui_analysis_window">analysis window</a> for this task.
  Lastly, tasks that are not needed anymore can be deleted by the user
  individually or all together by clicking the button "Delete All" at the bottom
  of the list.
</p>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Selection"
  id="panel_selection"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  This panel shows a list of all selected genes. Labels and the group are
  displayed for each genes to give the user an overview over their current
  seletion. Individual genes or the complete selection can be removed here.
</p>
