    The Drugst.One sidebar consists of different panels which can be individually
    integrated or excluded to fit your websites needs. If desired, the complete
    sidebar can be deactivated by setting the parameter 'showSidebar' to 'false'
    in the config. In the following, each panel and its functionality is
    described.

<p>
    The detail view shows the node information of the currently selected network component. The
    name and the group of the gene will be displayed here. If a gene can be found
    by Drugst.One in its database, the information will be complemented by
    information from different databases. If a tissue is selected, the exact
    measured expression value will be displayed here when the gene is selected. If
    the gene cab be found in the Drugst.One database and thus is available for
    selection, a button to toggle the selection status fo the gene will be
    displayed.

    the network or the selected genes, similar to the 'Connect Genes' function. In
    a second step, Drugst.One will execute a
    <a href="/doc#closeness_centrality">Closeness Centrality</a> algorithm on the
    resulting network, finding drug candidates that are related to the original
    seed genes.

<app-doc-subsubheader
        text="Analysis"
        id="panel_analysis"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
    The analysis panel gives the user three ways to analyze the selected seed
    genes. The <b>'drug target search'</b> allows to select algorithms that will
    find genes related to the seed genes. It depends on the selected algorithm, if
    the algorithm will try to find genes in between the seed genes or if the
    algorithm searches for new genes in close proximity to the seed genes. These
    genes can extend existing disease module or, if seen in the context of drug
    repurposing, represent putative drug targets. The <b>'drug search'</b> works
    similar, but the algorithms will return a list of putative drugs in the
    network neighborhood of the seed genes. Lastly, the
    <b>'enrichment analysis'</b> will export the list of selected genes either to
    <a href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost" target="_blank">g:Profiler</a> or <a
        href="https://digest-validation.net" target="_blank">DIGEST</a>
    which offer different evaluation, enrichment, profiling and conversion methods. Another option is to search for
    selected proteins in NDEx integrated Query (<a href="https://www.ndexbio.org/iquery/" target="_blank">iQuery</a>) to
    show curated pathways with the same participants.

<app-doc-subsubheader text="Tasks" id="panel_tasks"></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
    The task list offers an overview over the tasks and indicates the used
    algorithm, the status of the Task ('running', 'done', 'failed') and a
    timestamp. While the tasks should never fail, in the case of an error and the
    task status 'failed', a short error message will be displayed to inform the
    user. In this case, please <a href="/doc#contact_us">reach out to us</a> with
    the displayed message. In the task list, tasks will be listed chronologically
    from newest to oldest. A click on a task in this list opens the
    <a href="/doc#drugstone_ui_analysis_window">analysis window</a> for this task.
    Lastly, tasks that are not needed anymore can be deleted by the user
    individually or all together by clicking the button 'Delete All' at the bottom
    of the list.

    This panel shows a list of all selected genes. Labels and the group are
    displayed for each genes to give the user an overview over their current
    selection. Individual genes or the complete selection can be removed here. Genes can be manually selected by
    double-clicking nodes in the network, checking boxes in the according tabular view, or by using the 'rectangular
    select' function, which can be used by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> and then holding the left mouse button down while
    dragging the cursor over the network. Options for selection expansion are provided though the 'Add First neighbors'
    and 'Add Connected Components' buttons, that use the current selection list as input.

    based on a selection of other networks. The user can create a view by
    selecting a network and a selection of genes in the network. The view will
    then be created and displayed in the network panel. The user can also delete
    views from the list. The view list is saved in the browser's local storage
    and will be restored when the user returns to the page.
