  The analysis window can be opened by clicking on finished tasks in the task
  list in the sidebar. The analysis window consists of three different tabs: The
  "table", the "network" and the "parameters".
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The "table" contains all the data used for the analysis. Here are tables
    displayed which show the genes/proteins of the search and which ones were
    found by the algorithm. If applicable, an additional table ranks the found
    drugs.
  </li>
  <li>
    The "network" shows the resulting network in the analysis context. It
    displays the complete input network such that the found nodes can be
    interpreted in its context. The network menu in the analysis view has the
    option to highlight the used seed nodes for the analysis task, hence the
    genes which the algorithm received as input. In addition to the initial
    network, the analysis network contains additional node groups for the found
    nodes ("foundNodes") and for possible connectors ("connectorNode").
  </li>
  <li>
    The "parameters" tab contains all information needed to reproduce the
    results. Here you can find the name of the used algorithm, the version
    numbers of the used datasets and the additional parameters that were set by
    the user.
  </li>
</ul>
