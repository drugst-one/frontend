<p>
  For R-Shiny apps there were so far no specific framework related problems
  apparent that would demand some specific framework configuration. Some
  functionalities necessary to fully use drugst.one may not be natively
  supported by R-shiny but you can always use the normal
  <a href="basic_integration">JavaScript</a> functions as a fallback
  option.<br />

  To adjust network and configuration dynamically, make sure that the created
  JSON file has the correct structure and fields as described in the
  <a href="customize_general">customization</a> section.<br />

  Also in the future a standalone R-Shiny Drugst.One plugin is planned, that
  allows direct use of standard R network objects.
