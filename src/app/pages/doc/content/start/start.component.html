In this section steps that are necessary to integrate a basic version of Drugst.One are prepared. Besides pure <i>javascript</i> and
<i>html</i> projects we are aware that most projects nowadays are build upon some more sophisticated frameworks. For some of those specific instructions are already available alongside some example implementations. Those can be found by following this
<a pButton pRipple class="p-button-outlined clipboard-btn" icon="fab fa-github" pTooltip="View example code repository!"
   tooltipPosition="right" style="border: none; top: +.2rem; width: 1.5rem; height: 1.5rem"
   href="https://github.com/drugst-one/integration-examples"
   target="_blank"> </a> button or the specific ones besides the header of the relevant section.

The example implementations show you how to set up the drugst.one plugin with some initial <a
        (click)="navigateTo('cust-network')">network</a><a (click)="navigateTo('cust-config')">configuration</a> and <a
        (click)="navigateTo('cust-style')">styling</a> but further depicts live adjustments of those entries, in particular adding new nodes to the network or adjusting the panel background color. We also show how to listen to
<a (click)="navigateTo('cust-events')">analysis
    events</a> and how to open them from the host site. These examples are just to show how to implement some basic functionalities of drugst.one in your framework of choice. A full documentation over all options you have with drugst.one is available in the <a (click)="navigateTo('customize')">section</a>.
