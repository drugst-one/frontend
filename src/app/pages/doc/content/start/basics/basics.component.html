For the integration of Drugst.One into an simple html project, the drugstone plugin has to be imported. For this unly two lines of code have to be added in the
<code>head</code> section of your html file:
<app-code lang="html" [code]="basicCode"></app-code>
More info about the version tag, here <code>@{{version}}/{{server}}</code> can be found in the dedicated <a
        (click)="navigateTo('cust-version')">version</a> section.<br>
Adding these import lines loads the plugin from a content delivery network and allows now the use of the <code>{{'<'}}
    network-expander{{'>'}}</code> tag.
An unconfigured and customized version of Drugst.one can therefore be integrated by creating an html component:
<app-code lang="html" code="<html>
    <network-expander id='drugstone-component-id'></network-expander>
</html>"></app-code>
The idea can of course be changed or removed but is here set specifically to "drugstone-component-id" for documentation consistency reasons.
To add <a (click)="navigateTo('cust-network')">network</a> information, or customize <a
        (click)="navigateTo('cust-style')">styling</a> or general <a
        (click)="navigateTo('cust-config')">configuration</a> please refer to the specific sections.
