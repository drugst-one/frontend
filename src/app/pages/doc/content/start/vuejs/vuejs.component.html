Vue.js will return an error warning when just doing the <a (click)="navigateTo('basics')">basic setup</a> steps. To allow the use of an external components in Vue.js an entry has to be added to the <code>externals</code> object <i>vue.config.js</i> :
<app-code lang="js" [code]="externalsCode"></app-code>
This configuration should be enough to now use the Drugst.One plugin as in any other framework.
