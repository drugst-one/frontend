<p>
  Vue.js will return an error warning when just doing the
  <a href="/doc#basic_integration">basic setup</a> steps. To allow the use of
  an external components in Vue.js an entry has to be added to the
  <code>externals</code> object <i>vue.config.js</i> : The way this entry has to
  be specifically structure can differ between versions and setups.<br />
  Basic vue.js 2 project:
  <app-code lang="js" [code]="vueCode"></app-code>
  Vue.js 2 webpack project:
  <app-code lang="js" [code]="webpackCode"></app-code>
  This configuration should be enough to now use the Drugst.One plugin as in any
  other framework.
