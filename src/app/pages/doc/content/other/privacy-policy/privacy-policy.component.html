  The Drugst.One plugin only stores data to provide full functionality to the
  user. Upon starting an analysis task in the explorer, a task identification
  string is anonymously stored in your browser. This enables you to revisit
  previous analysis tasks without storing the URLs and to select tasks to
  summarize them. When removing the data of the Drugst.One plugin, previous
  analysis tasks will not appear in the task list anymore. The Drugst.One plugin
  uses no cookies or tracks of user data in any way.

<p>
  All data is processed directly the Drugst.One Server if not stated otherwise
  by the host website. Task results are stored on the server such that tasks can
  be revisited and shared. All data will be deleted on inactivity.
