  Drugst.One offers the possibility to analyze the displayed genes and proteins
  (nodes) in regard to network models and drug repurposing. Given nodes can be
  connected by shortest paths, modules can be extended by new highly
  interconnected nodes. Further, drugs can be found that target the nodes in the
  network. Thus, Drugst.One also functions as a drug repurposing tool.

  To this end, Drugst.One offers different algorithms which can be chosen by the
  user to fit the application case. It is up to the developer of the website,
  which algorithms are available for selection or if the analysis function is
  enabled at all.
