<p>
  Drugst.One offers the possibility to analyze the displayed genes and proteins
  (nodes) in regard to network models and drug repurposing. Given nodes can be
  connected by shortest paths, modules can be extended by new highly
  interconnected nodes. Further, drugs can be found that target the nodes in the
  network. Thus, Drugst.One also functions as a drug repurposing tool.
</p>

<p>
  To this end, Drugst.One offers different algorithms which can be chosen by the
  user to fit the application case. It is up to the developer of the website,
  which algorithms are available for selection or if the analysis function is
  enabled at all.

<p>To estimate the runtime of the Drugst.One algorithms, the algorthms were executed for each scenario (drug-target & drug search) 
  on multiple diseases from NeDRexDB with varying input sizes. For the sake of this runtime analysis, the diseases were grouped 
  based on the number of known disease genes (inputs of sizes 10, 25, 50, and 100). If necessary, the disease-associated genes were 
  randomly subsampled. The code as well as the results can be found here:

<p>
  The Multi-level Steiner tree algorithm is used to approximate the minimum
  spanning tree spanned by the seed nodes in a reasonable time. The
  implementation is adopted from
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02627" target="_blank">Ahmed et al.</a>
  It can be used to create a minimum spanning subnetwork between user-selected
  seed nodes, which happen to be central interaction partners between the seed
  nodes, and thus represent favorable drug-targets.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Number of Steiner trees:</i> Number of computed Steiner trees to
    approximate minimum spanning tree. A higher number leads to more variations
    at the cost of a longer runtime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Tolerance:</i> Indicates how much the subsequent trees may increase the
    number of edges.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  KeyPathwayMiner (KPM) is an online tool developed by
  <a
    href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/44/W1/W98/2499355"
    target="_blank"
    >Alcaraz et al.</a
  >
  for pathway enrichment analysis. Users have the option to utilize KPM for
  their drug-target search by selecting seed nodes in the GGI network and
  letting KPM find an interaction network of genes that are commonly
  dysregulated spanned by the seed genes. The resulting proteins are presumably
  functionally related to the seed nodes, and therefore are suitable drug-target
  candidates. Only one parameter K has to be set by the user which defines the
  amount of permitted intermediate nodes that are neither part of the seed nodes
  nor the common pathway.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Additional proteins (k):</i> Number of intermediate nodes that are
    allowed in between the seed nodes.
  </li>
</ul>

<app-doc-subsubheader

></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  Harmonic centrality measurement can be described as the average shortest
  distance from each node to all other nodes in a network. This measurement is
  the equivalent of harmonic centrality for disconnected graphs. Formally
  speaking, it can be annotated as
</p>

<div class="documentation-formula">
  <i>centrality<sub>harmonic</sub>(x) = </i>&sum;<sub>y&#x2260;x</sub
  ><sup>y</sup>( 1 / dist(x, y) )
</div>
<p>
  where x is a given node and 1/dist(x, y) = 0 if dist(x, y) = ∞ (<a
    href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Closeness-Centrality-Extended-to-Unconnected-the-Rochat/a4ea7b92421415674c6ed954914f0512935d0dfb"
    target="_blank"
    >reference</a
  >). The closer a node is to other nodes, the higher the score. It has already
  been proven successful in a number of biological network problems for instance
  with

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Degree Centrality"

<p>
  Degree centrality measurement is obtained by ranking the nodes in a network
  based on their degree, which is defined as the number of neighbors a node has
  divided by the number of nodes. It be described as
</p>

<div class="documentation-formula">
  <i>centrality<sub>degree</sub>(x) = deg(x)</i>
</div>

<p>
  where x is a given node and deg(x) is its degree. While it is a
  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21575741/" target="_blank"
    >commonly used network analysis technique</a
  >, it most importantly has been shown useful in the
  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26355787/" target="_blank"
    >identification of essential proteins in PPI networks</a
  >. Thus, it is a simple approach to classifying the network-related importance
  of a particular protein. In Drugst.One it can be used to discover valuable
  drug-targets or drugs, based on the seed selection given by the user.

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Betweenness Centrality"
  id="betweenness_centrality"
></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  Betweenness is obtained by finding the shortest paths for each pair of nodes
  in the network and assessing the number of shortest paths that pass through a
  particular node, such that a measure of the centrality of a node in a network
  global context is received. Betweenness Centrality has been established as a
  common measurement in
  <a

    target="_blank"

  >
  application and is especially practical in
  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/99/12/7821" target="_blank"
    >finding communities in large networks</a
  >. In Drugst.One, betweenness is based on the shortest paths between the seed
  nodes only and can be used to find drug targets with maximized connectivity to
  all seeds.

<app-doc-subsubheader text="Trustrank" id="trustrank"></app-doc-subsubheader>
<p>
  TrustRank is based on the same concepts as the
  <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/" target="_blank"
    >Google PageRank algorithm</a
  >
  and Harmonic Centrality. A crawler searches the network based on user-selected
  seeds and ranks visited nodes, damping the score based on the distance
  traveled. The damping factor can be set by the user in a range from 0-1, with
  a higher damping factor causing the crawler to explore nodes in close
  proximity or in larger portions of the GGI network. In Drugst.One, TrustRank
  is able to find putative drug targets as well as drug candidates.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Damping Factor:</i> The speed with which the crawler propagates through
    the network. The larger the factor, the larger the proportion of the network
    that is considered.
  </li>
</ul>

<app-doc-subsubheader
  text="Network Proximity"

<p>
  As introduced in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17189-2" target="_blank"
    >Sadegh et al.</a
  > we adopted the modified version of the originally proposed network-based proximity metric proposed by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10331" target="_blank"
    >Guney et al.</a
  >,.
Network proximity is defined as the average length of shortest paths from target protein nodes of a drug to a set of disease nodes, called seeds. A background distribution is computed by creating a specified number (default 32) of random drug target sets and a specified number of random seed sets (default 32). Drug target set sizes are chosen to represent the observed drug degrees in the drug-target network, differing from the original bin-based degree-preserving set randomization. The average shortest path between each observed drug-target set and the input seed set is compared to the background distribution to compute a statistical significance score (z-core) using mean and standard deviation of the background. 
This algorithm was adopted in Drugst.One such that highest-scoring drugs are returned to the user as candidate drugs.

<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Number Random Seed Sets:</i>  Default 32. Sets the number of random seed sets generate to establish the background distribution.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Number Random Drug Target Sets:</i>  Default 32. Sets the number of random drug target sets generated to establish the background distribution.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of the algorithms can be adjusted to your needs with parameters. We also
  provide custom options such as filtering out unapproved or nutraceutical
  drugs. In general, the following options exist:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Result Size: </i>Number of returned results (drug-targets or drugs)
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Maximum Degree: </i>Option to filter out hub genes. if set to > 0, genes
    with a network degree in the complete gene-drug interaction network above
    this threshold will be excluded.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Hub Penalty: </i>Penalize genes with a large degree in the network. The
    higher the value, the more algorithms will try to avoid genes with a high
    network degree in the complete gene-drug interaction network.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Filter Edges: </i>If set, only the shortest paths to the results
    (drug-target genes or drugs) will be displayed in the resulting network.
    Otherwise, all found pathways will be shown.
  </li>
</ul>
