                    The customization of the panel is achieved by handing over parameters to the component. All the
                    configuration parameters, their syntax and structure can be checked in the Documentation or
                    interactively explored and set in the Playground tab. Any configuration created there can be copied
                    and directly added to your project and provides an easy way to quickly set up drugst.one to your
                    liking and to get familiar with its use.
                    The color theme of drugst.one can also be adjusted freely by setting specific css variables for your
                    website. These can be of course adjusted manually, but again the Playground tab has some nice
                    features to create a theme that fits into your application. The available variables are the
                    following:
                </div>
            </app-doc-page>
            <app-doc-page [id]="3" [currentPage]="page" [navTree]="navTree">
            </app-doc-page>
        </div>
